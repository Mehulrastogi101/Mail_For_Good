# Planned features

Below is a short, sure-to-change list of current priorities and planned features.

Current:

- Fix any issues encountered while using the application.
- Streamline the build process to integrate HTTPS with certificates using Lets Encrypt should a public domain name exist. This entails the additional feature of using Nginx rather than the current port forward.
- Whitelist users so that only certain users may use the app.

Future additions:

- A public API that can be securely accessed to perform actions such as sending individual emails or entire campaigns.
- Inbound SMTP relay functionality.
