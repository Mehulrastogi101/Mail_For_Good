## How to install

Get the app up and running by following our [**AWS deployment guide**](/aws-deployment-guide). After following these steps watch [**this guide**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7U03GVD4a8) to set up the keys you'll need for sending emails.

Want to test the app on your own machine? Check out our [**local deployment guide**](/local-deployment-guide).

## Troubleshooting

We're keen to tackle any issues people encounter. If you experience any problems, please create an issue and we'll get back to you.

If at any point you changed a file after running `docker-compose`, run `docker-compose up --force-recreate` to ensure they're included.
