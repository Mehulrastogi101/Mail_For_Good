# Deploying Mail for Good on AWS

### Get up and running on Amazon

Right after you log in to AWS you will land on this page.

![](resources/deploy_images/1.png)


Scroll down until you see the "build a solution" box as below, then select "Launch a virtual machine".

![](resources/deploy_images/2.png)

Click on the "Get started" button in the "EC2 Instance" box.

![](resources/deploy_images/3.png)

Give your instance a name. In this example, we will go with "Mail-for-Good"

![](resources/deploy_images/4.png)

Select Ubuntu as your operating system.

![](resources/deploy_images/5.png)

Here is the preselected instance is fine. (t2.micro instances are eligible for the free tier).

![](resources/deploy_images/6.png)

AWS will now create an SSH key for your instance. You will need this file to login to the remote server.

We will call this file `MfG-private-key`.

AWS will now create your instance.

You should see this when it's done.

### Configure your AWS instance

In the navbar at the top of the screen select "EC2" under the "Compute" category.

![](resources/deploy_images/10.png)

In the menu on the left of your screen, click on "Instances"

![](resources/deploy_images/11.png)

Then scroll the box containing the instances to the far right until you see "Security Groups".

![](resources/deploy_images/13.png)

Click on the security group of your instance and open the "Inbound" tab

![](resources/deploy_images/14.png)

then "Edit".

![](resources/deploy_images/15.png)

Add the following rule, as pictured:

```
type: custom tcp rule
protocol: tcp
port range: 80
source: custom 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0
```

### Allocate a static IP to your instance

By default AWS will allocate you a new address every time your instance starts up.

To get a static IP go to navbar -> EC2 -> left menu -> Elastic IPs.

![](resources/deploy_images/navbar_ec2_elasticIP.png)

Then click on "Allocate new address".

![](resources/deploy_images/elastic_allocate_new.png)

Once your Elastic IP is created click on Actions -> "Associate address".

![](resources/deploy_images/elastic_associate.png)

Leave the Resource Type as its default ("Instance").

Select the Instance you just created and its Private IP.

### Connect to your new EC2 server

In the navbar at the top of your screen select "EC2" under the "Compute" category.

![](resources/deploy_images/10.png)

In the menu on the left of your screen, click on "Instances".

![](resources/deploy_images/11.png)

Select your instance. Then take note of the "Public DNS (IPv4)" of your application. In this case, ours is "ec2-54-77-4-200.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com".

###### In the commands below, you'll need to replace what's between < and > with what is described.

---

Copy the private key you downloaded earlier and put it somewhere safe. By default, it will probably be in `~/Downloads`. You can check this with:

```
cd ~/Downloads && cat ./MfG-private-key.pem
```

We'll assume this is true and copy the key to our home directory (you may wish to do otherwise, bear this in mind):

```
cp ~/Downloads/MfG-private-key.pem ~/
```

Before using your key you will need to make it readable by running:

```
chmod 400 <path to your key>
```

Which would be the following command for our example:

```
chmod 400 ~/MfG-private-key.pem
```

Log into your instance:

```
ssh -i "<path to the key file you downloaded earlier>" ubuntu@<your Public DNS (IPv4) from Amazon>
```

In our example we would use this command:

```
ssh -i "~/MfG-private-key.pem" ubuntu@ec2-54-77-4-200.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
```

If everything went well so far you should see the following text:

```

```

You are now logged in to your instance.

### Install docker and docker-compose on your instance

---
###### From this point onwards all commands should be run on the AWS Instance you just logged in to.

###### The installation process for docker is described in more detail at https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/. Check this out for more details.
---

Update your package sources:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
```

Install packages to allow `apt` to use a repository over HTTPS:

```
$ sudo apt-get install \
 apt-transport-https \
 ca-certificates \
 curl \
 software-properties-common
```

Add Docker’s official GPG key:

```
$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```

Install the docker version currently marked as "stable":

```
$ sudo add-apt-repository \
 "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
 $(lsb_release -cs) \
 stable"
 ```

To install docker-compose run:

```
sudo apt-get install docker-compose
```

### Get set up with Google authentication

Login to [Google API Manager](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/).

In the left menu, select **Dashboard**. Now select **Enable API**, search for `Google+` and select it. At the top of the screen, ensure it's enabled by clicking on **Enable**.

In the left menu, select **Credentials**. Then click **Create Credentials** > **OAuth client ID**.

Select **Web Application**. Name it as you wish
  - Under **Authorised Javascript Origins** put the “Public DNS (IPv4)” you received from Amazon earlier.
  - Under **Authorised redirect URIs** put your “Public DNS (IPv4)” followed by `/auth/google/callback`.

![](resources/deploy_images/google_origins.png)

**Any issues here? Double check that both URLs are preceeded with http://**.

Click **Create**.

### Configure Mail for Good

Clone Mail-for-Good:

```
git clone https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/mail-for-good && cd mail-for-good
```

Create a .env file:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit your .env according to the comments present in it:

```
nano .env
```

In particular, you need to edit these four attributes:

```
  # Your Google Client ID
  # E.g. 1234547812345-12345qrp123459bzcd12345660412345.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CONSUMER_KEY=
  # Your Client Secret
  # E.g abcdefQVw1ghijzeaQklmnop
GOOGLE_CONSUMER_SECRET=
  # The URL Google will send you back to after logging in.
  # It must match what is under "Authorised redirect URIs" in the Google Dashboard exactly
GOOGLE_CALLBACK=
  # A random, preferably long sequence of characters. You do not need to remember this.
ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD=
```

To write your changes, press CTRL+O (then confirm your choice).

Press CTRL+X to exit.

### Launch Mail-for-Good

All done! Run the command below and wait for it to finish. This may take some time:

```
sudo docker-compose up
```

Finally, close the terminal. Do not exit the app before doing so.

### Visit your app

You can now visit the app by visiting your "Public DNS (IPv4)".

In our example we would visit "ec2-54-77-4-200.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com".
